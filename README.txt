Hi There,

Welcome to my Mastery project for an A/B test of Globox's new banner.

For the code to compile and output correctly the file_path variable will need to be adjusted to the file path that
this folder is extracted to. In the form:

r'<file path here>'

The link to the loom video is here, it's quite rushed and missed me discussing the conclusions in any depth.

Anyways, thank you for your time!
